## Features

### Simple User Interface

RedstoneBot offers a simple set of commands for you and your pals to interact with your PloudOS servers from the coziness of your Discord server. For instance:

* `!redstone status` allows you to check on the status of your server.
* `!redstone time` displays the current queue waiting times.
* `!redstone start` activates your server **and automatically sends user confirmation!**
* `!redstone stop` deactivates your server.
* And more! 

You can view a full list of commands by running the `!redstone help` command.

### Easy Permissions Management

Sharing control of your PloudOS server with your friends can be a hassle sometimes, due to the clunky and oftentimes slow PloudOS web UI.

RedstoneBot also makes it easier, safer and faster to manage who gets to control your PloudOS server by using a simple two-tier role system.

* The **Redstone User** role grants basic permissions: checking on your server status, checking on queue waiting times, and activating your server

* The **Redstone Admin** role grants full control of your PloudOS server and all RedstoneBot commands - this includes all _Redstone user_ commands, exiting the activation queue, deactivating your server, and access to special configuration commands.
